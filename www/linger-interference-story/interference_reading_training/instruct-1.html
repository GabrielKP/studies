        <p>In this study, you will be asked to read different stories.</p>

        <p>
          The color of the story text and the pace at which they are presented
          will vary, but your task will always be: to attend to and understand
          each narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the time, the story will be shown in black text with a white
          background.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes you will be asked to read a different story, shown in
          purple.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the purple sentences, each sentence will be displayed for a fixed
          amount of time, after which the next sentence will be shown.
