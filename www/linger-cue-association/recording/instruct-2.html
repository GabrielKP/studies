        The recording will help us verify that you are attentive and do not use
        AI during the experiment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The recording will not extend beyond the boundaries of the web browser
        (e.g., it will not include your computer desktop or other applications),
        and it will be limited to the duration of the experiment only. Any such
        screen recording will not be used for advertising or non-study related
        purposes.

          We will only use these screen recordings for the purposes of this
          research. We will not make them publicly available.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you agree to screen recording and then change your mind, you may
          ask us to destroy the recording for any reason.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Before you start the recording, close all windows other than your
        current web browser. You do not need to use an incognito window, but
        make sure to close all browser tabs that are open right now, except the
        one for the experiment.

          experiment, or your data may be lost.</b
