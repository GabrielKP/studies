      This screen recording can be captured using the Zoom application. If you do not have Zoom downloaded, you may
      download it using this site: https://zoom.us/download/
      </p>

      <p>Once you have downloaded Zoom, follow these steps to screen record:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Close all windows on your computer except your web browser with this experiment.</li>
        <li>Open Zoom and start a new meeting.</li>
        <li>Change your name.</li>
        <li>Click the Share Screen button.</li>
        <li>Choose the browser window you want to share (do not share your entire screen).</li>
        <li>Click Record in the Zoom toolbar to start the recording.</li>
        <li>When you finish, click Stop Recording in the Zoom toolbar.</li>
        <li>The recording will be saved to your computer automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you would like to record your screen using another application, you are more than welcome to do so. Please,
        just ensure that it is a recording of only your browser and does not expose your personally identifying
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Please, only proceed to the next question once you have started screen recording!</b>
      </p>

      <p>I confirm that I have started screen recording my browser.</p>
