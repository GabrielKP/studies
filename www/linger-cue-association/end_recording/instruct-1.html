        It may take a few minutes for your screen recording to save to your computer.
      </p>

      <p> <b>Make sure your recording is saved as an .mp4 file NOT a .zoom file. </b>
        If it is a .zoom file, we will be unable to review it and you may not receive full compensation for this study.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all recent versions of Zoom will automatically convert meetings to .mp4 format for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have issues with this, please send us a message on Prolific and we will do our best to help!
      </p>

      <p>Once your recording has saved, upload it here: <br>
        https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/gkressi1_jh_edu/EphOh_kBCGBDsgR9IxCdTdIB7glO9m2zd3bcIYub4MVETw
      </p>

      <p>Copy and paste this link into a new browser tab for the upload, and DO NOT close the current tab. You will know
        the upload is complete when the words "<b>Finished uploading</b>" appear. </p>

      <p>After you complete the upload, the link will prompt you with two boxes to enter your First and Last Name.
        Please, do NOT write your actual first and last name in the boxes. Just copy your Prolific ID and study ID and
        enter it into
        both boxes.</p>

      <p>Your prolific ID: <span id="participant-id"></span></p>
      <p>Your study ID: <span id="study-id"></span></p>

      I confirm that I uploaded my screen recording and wrote my Prolific ID and Study ID under both name fields.
