      <p><b>1. Research Summary (Key Information):</b></p>

      <p>
        The information in this section is intended to be an introduction to the
        study only. Details of the study are listed in the sections below. You
        can ask questions about the study now and at any time in the future, by
        contacting us at
        <a href="mailto:honeylabonline@gmail.com">honeylabonline@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The overall objective of this project is to determine the cognitive and
        neural mechanisms that tag specific experiences to enter and persist in
        our thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participation is this study will typically take 20-50 minutes.
        Participants are required to attend and respond to a variety of stimuli,
        including sequences of spoken language and questions about their
        impressions and ideas. Participants are also required to type words.
        There are no known physical or psychological risks associated with your
        participation in this study, other than the possibility of fatigue,
        boredom, or discomfort. The only cost for participation is a
        participant’s time. The benefit of participating in this study is to be
        involved in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the human
        brain. Participants are compensated at a flat rate or via course credit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>

      <p><b>2. Why is this research being done?</b></p>

      <p>
        This research is being done to examine how memory and perceptual
        functions interact in the brain. In particular, we are interested how
        the brain enables us to perceive streams of information over time.
        People between the ages of 18-65 who speak English may join.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p><b>3. What will happen if you join this study?</b></p>

      <p>
        If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following
        things:
      </p>

      <p>
        You will participate in a computerized task. You will read or listen to
        a series of sentences, or you will see a series of images or short
        movies on the screen, or may hear a series of sounds. Your task is to
        carefully attend to each piece of language, or movie, or image. so that
        you can report what you saw or heard. Your reading or listening may be
        interrupted by alternate tasks, such as having to wait for 15 seconds,
        simple counting of geometric shapes, or answering comprehension
        questions about a simple situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes we will ask you to directly report what you saw or heard, for
        example by providing a yes/no response (e.g. "Was the image moving?" or
        "Did you hear the same sound twice in a row?"). In other cases, we may
        ask you to make a judgment about images (e.g. "Which images belong
        together?") or about other features of the stimuli (e.g. "Which sound
        was louder?"). In still other cases, we may ask you to make a prediction
        about the stimuli (e.g. “What would you expect to hear or see next?”).
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, you may be tested on your memory of what you saw or heard
        or asked to provide short descriptions of life events. You may also be
        asked to answer questions about your ability to pay attention and focus.
        After completing the main experiment, we will ask you to ﬁll out a brief
        questionnaire that asks about some optional personal information (e.g.,
        your age-range) and gives you an opportunity to comment on your
        experience performing the task. The study will typically take 20-50
        minutes to complete. The first phase of the experiment will typically
        take 10-30 minutes. The second and third phase of the experiment will
        each take 5-10 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        All participants will be exposed to all phases of the experiment.
        Additionally, participants may see different stimuli, and the order and
        selection of these stimuli is chosen at random, like drawing numbers
        from a hat. At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to complete
        some brief surveys about the study and your experience.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        <b><u>How long will you be in the study?</u></b>
      </p>
      <p>You will be in this study for 20-50 minutes.</p>

      <br />
      <p><b>4. What are the risks or discomforts of the study?</b></p>

      <p>
        Completing this study requires reading text, which may include
        narratives with mature themes. These themes could include violence,
        harassment, death, and adult relationships. These themes may be
        disturbing and uncomfortable for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions, or when you
        are completing questionnaires. There is a risk when answering these
        questions that information about you may become known to people outside
        this study. While personally identifiable information is not collected
        in this study, we do collect demographics information including but not
        limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, handedness, and age of language
        acquisition. Please note that all demographic questions are optional and
        are not required to successfully participate in this study.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information from online studies will be de- coupled from online IDs to
        decrease the risk of linking your information with your person. The
        experimental data from your session may be shared with the NIH’s Data
        Archive or other databases, but only after de-identification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from this, the risks associated with participation in this study
        are no greater than those encountered in daily life or during the
        performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p><b>5. Are there benefits to being in the study?</b></p>

      <p>
        There is no direct benefit to you from being in this study. This study
        may benefit society if the results lead to a better understanding of how
        people process streams of information.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        <b>6. What are your options if you do not want to be in the study?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You choose
        whether to participate. If you decide not to participate, there are no
        penalties, and you will not lose any benefits to which you would
        otherwise be entitled. If you are employed by or are a student at Johns
        Hopkins University or Johns Hopkins Hospital, your employment or
        enrollment will not be affected.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p><b>7. Will it cost you anything to be in this study?</b></p>

      <p>The only costs to participants are their time and attention.</p>

      <br />
      <p><b>8. Will you be paid if you join this study?</b></p>

      <p>
        If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive monetary
        compensation (typically $15 per hour) for your participation. If you end
        your participation before completing the study, you will be paid for
        your participation up to that time. Payments are made via Prolific.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p><b>9. Can you leave the study early?</b></p>

      <p>
        You can agree to be in the study now and change your mind later, without
        any penalty or loss of benefits or decrease in payment for your time. If
        you wish to stop, please tell us right away. If you want to withdraw
        from the study, please convey this to the experimenter. Leaving this
        study early will not affect your employment/education.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p><b>10. Why might we take you out of the study early?</b></p>

      <p>You may be taken out of the study if:</p>
      <p>- Staying in the study would be harmful.</p>
      <p>- You fail to follow instructions.</p>
      <p>- The study is cancelled.</p>
      <p>
        - • There may be other reasons to take you out of the study that we do
        not know at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are taken out of the study early, Johns Hopkins may use or give
        out your information that it has already collected if the information is
        needed for this study or any follow-up activities.

          protected?</b
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Any study records that identify you will be kept conﬁdential to the
        extent possible by law. The records from your participation may be
        reviewed by people responsible for making sure that research is done
        properly, including members of the Johns Hopkins University Homewood
        Institutional Review Board and ofﬁcials from government agencies such as
        the National Institutes of Health and the Ofﬁce for Human Research
        Protections (all of these people are required to keep your identity
        conﬁdential). Otherwise, records that identify you will be available
        only to people working on the study, unless you give permission for
        other people to see the records. The experimental data and questionnaire
        responses collected during your participation will be anonymized.
      </p>

      <p>
        De-identiﬁed and anonymized data (e.g. response times, key presses, and
        questionnaire responses) may be made freely available to the scientiﬁc
        community to encourage scientiﬁc openness and reproducibility. This
        sharing of anonymous data may include depositing data in open data
        repositories, such as
        <a href="https://openneuro.org">https://openneuro.org</a>, or in curated
        data repositories, such as the National Institute of Mental Health Data
        Archive (NDA). If you would like more information about NDA, this is

      <p>
        Under some experimental conditions, the anonymized and de-identiﬁed raw
        data, such as generated word associations, may also be shared with other
        participants. In such cases, the raw data will be manually scrubbed of
        any personally identiﬁable information. If you have any concerns about
        sharing of anonymized data, please do not participate.
